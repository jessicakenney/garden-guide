        <h1>Documentation</h1>
        <hr/>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Welcome to the api for Garden Guide, the go to API for home gardening! This documentation should help you familiarise yourself with the resources available and how to consume them with HTTP requests. Read through the getting started section before you dive in. Most of your problems should be solved just by reading through it.</p>
        <h3>Getting started</h3>
        <p>Let's make our first API request!</p>
        <p>Open up a terminal and use <a href="http://curl.haxx.se">curl</a> or <a href="http://httpie.org">httpie</a> to make an API request for a resource. In the example below, we're trying to get the first plant, Tomato:</p>
        <pre><code>localhost:4567/gardenguideapi/plants
</code></pre>
        <p>We'll use <a href="http://httpie.org">httpie</a> for our examples as it displays responses nicely and gives us a whole lot more useful information. If you don't want to download httpie, just use the <em>curl</em> command instead.</p>
        <p>Here is the response we get:</p>
        <pre><code>[
  {
    "plantName": "tomato",
    "daysToMaturity": 92,
    "plantSpacing": "1 foot",
    "rowSpacing": "2ft"
  },
  {
    "plantName": "carrot",
    "daysToMaturity": 82,
    "plantSpacing": "2 foot",
    "rowSpacing": "3ft"
  },
  {
    "plantName": "beet",
    "daysToMaturity": 72,
    "plantSpacing": "3 foot",
    "rowSpacing": "4ft"
  },
  {
    "plantName": "basil",
    "daysToMaturity": 22,
    "plantSpacing": "4 foot",
    "rowSpacing": "5ft"
  },
  {
    "plantName": "cilantro",
    "daysToMaturity": 12,
    "plantSpacing": "5 foot",
    "rowSpacing": "6ft"
  },
  {
    "plantName": "jalapeno",
    "daysToMaturity": 62,
    "plantSpacing": "6 foot",
    "rowSpacing": "7ft"
  }
]
</code></pre>
        <p>Or you can try to following code to pull specific plant data:</p>
        <pre><code>localhost:4567/gardenguideapi/plants/:plantName
</code></pre>

        <p>If your response looks slightly different don't panic. This is probably because more data has been added to Garden Guide API since we made this documentation.</p>
        <p><a name="base"></a></p>
        <h3>Rate limiting</h3>
        <p>Rate limiting is done via IP address and is currently limited to 100 API request per day. This is enough to request all the data on the website at least once. There should be no reason for hitting the rate limit.</p>
        <p><a name="auth"></a></p>
        <h3>Authentication</h3>
        <p>Garden Guide is a <strong>completely open API</strong>. No authentication is required to query and get data. This also means that we've limited what you can do to just <strong>GET</strong>-ing the data.</p>
        <p><a name="schema"></a></p>
        <h3>JSON Schema</h3>
        <p>All resources support <a href="https://jsonschema.net">JSON Schema</a>.</p>
        <h1>Encodings</h1>
        <hr/>
        <p>Garden Guide API provides two encodings for you to render the data with:</p>
        <p><a name="json"></a></p>
        <h3>JSON</h3>
        <p>JSON is the standard data format provided by Garden Guide API by default.</p>
